<h2>A Visualization of Airplane Crash Accidents</h2>

<p class="MainText">
  In this modern day, planes are a common way for people around the world to travel large distance across the world in a relatively 
  short amount of time. However, being up in the sky also poses some risks as if an accident happens on the plane, the whole plane will 
  come crashing down, risking the lives of everyone on the plane. An aviation accident is defined by the Convention on International 
  Civil Aviation Annex 13 as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft, which takes place from any time a person has 
  chose to use a plane until they finish using it and involves either a) the person in the aircraft suffering from serious injury, b) 
  the aircraft itself sustaining significant damage/ structural failure, and/or c) the aircraft has gone missing or inaccessible. 
</p>

<p class="MainText">
  This visualization below will display the crashes of airplanes around the world with each red dot being a crash from 1920 to 2021. 
  The bigger the dot, the bigger the number of fatalities in the flight. You can hover around the visualization to see a short description
  of the crash.

<h3>Plane Crashes Around the World</h3>

<h3>There are also survivors of plane crashes...</h3>

<p class="MainText">
  Plane crashes usually involves hundreds of victims and fatalities in a single accident. However, there are many survivors of plane crashes
  as well. The research of the US NTSB concluded that there is about a 95% chance of survival based on their review of national aviation incident
  from 1983-1999, with about a 55% chance of survival instead in the case of a serious plane incident that where fire and substantial damages 
  to the plane occured.

  <h3>The number of accidents that happen depends on category of crash</h3>

  <p class="sub_text">
    There are many different categories for plane crashes, we can see that most of the plane crashes that happened involves cabin/cockpit fire which suggests that fre from inside the plane is the main cause of most of these accidents. There are also surprisingly large number of accidents that involves fuel starvation which is what happpens when an airplane runs out of fuel when they are in the middle of a flight due to either a miscalcualtion of the amount of fuel needed, forgot to resupply the fuel, or some other reasons that causes their number of fuel to be insufficient for the flight.
    The least amount of accident are the ones that involves bird strikes which is when an unfortunate bird crashes into one of the plane's engine
    causing it to malfunction and explode due to the collision.

    <h3>There is a trend in the number of fatalities and year</h3>

    <p class="sub_text">
      We can see from the graph that there was a spike in the number of fatalities per year from the year of 1950s to 2000s and the reason for that
      is because the US and many countries around the world started mass commercializing air travel. As such, the number of flights around the world
      skyrocketed and this in turn caused the number of plane accidents to skyrocket as well. This causes the upward trend that persisted from 
      the 1950s to the end of 2000s. From the year 2000s to 2021, however, we can see that there is a clear downward trend even though the number 
      of air travel have continued increasing. This is because airplane companies around the world started to pay more and more attention to 
      air travel safety causing less plane crashes and more survivors of plane crash. We can also see that the number of fatalities dropped to
      a very low amount around the year 2019 - 2021 and that is because of the corona virus pandemic whihc causes a lot of countries to restrict air travel
      and in turn, also lowers the number of crashes and fatalities.
